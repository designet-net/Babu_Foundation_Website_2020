<h3>How We Help Those Affected</h3>
<p>Babu increases access to menstrual care and education by mobilizing volunteers, and innovating sustainable solutions that shatter stigmas and limitations for women and girls.
<p>Around the world, girls and women resort to using rags, mattress stuffing, banana leaves, feathers, and even cow dung to manage their menstruation.</p>
<p> Girls' influencers such as parents and elderly provide missinformation, which prevent girls from obtaining knowledge and developing skills to keep themselves healthy.</p>
