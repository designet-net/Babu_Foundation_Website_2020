		<h3>How We Provide Clean Water</h3>
<p>Supports communities to establish Water Management Committees to bring safe water and improved sanitation to the children in our care. Clean water helps them stay healthy, remain active in school and focus their energy on overcoming poverty.</p>
<p>For children under five, water- and sanitation-related diseases are one of the leading causes of death. Every day, over 800 children die from preventable diseases caused by poor water, and a lack of sanitation and hygiene..</p>

<h3><img class="img-left-btm" align="left" src="babuimages/wash-water.jpg" alt=" " title="Nyabwiri"/>WATER AND SANITATION</h3>
<p>In Yorâ€™s community, villagers were provided a water system by the government but it was not functional for years. Therefore, villagers, especially girls and women, had to fetch water from the small stream nearby.</p>
<p>Although the distance to collect water was relatively short, it was not easy and the water was not clean. "The slippery path scared me when I fetched water from the stream. Sometimes, I fell down," says Vannessa. </p>
